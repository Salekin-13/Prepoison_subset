"""build_convergence.py -- the convergence table: how the asset-generation prompt moved, August to October 2026.

Run from the repository root (the folder that holds eval_assets.py):

    python <path>/build_convergence.py            # self-test, then writes convergence.csv and heldout.csv
    python <path>/build_convergence.py --out DIR  # write the two CSVs to DIR instead of next to this script

What it does
- Finds every asset-run folder (see FAMILIES), groups the repeats of one version, and scores each repeat with the
  project scorer: eval_assets.score(run_dir, eval_assets.load_refs()["gt"], strict=True, only=<split modules>).
- Tuning split = the 15 modules of RTL_data/ that have a reference entry (111 entries). Held-out split = the 26
  modules of RTL_heldout/ (189 entries). Tuning rows go to convergence.csv, held-out rows to heldout.csv.
- A run is COMPLETE when every module of its split has an output file. Means use complete runs only; incomplete
  runs are named in the description and left out of every number.
- P, R, F1 and emitted are means over complete runs of the per-run values (as eval_assets.ablate does).
  P = precision, R = recall, both strict. "emitted" counts listed elements in the scored modules only.
- Date: the earliest _run_meta.json "timestamp" of the version's complete runs; if no run has one, the earliest
  file mtime inside those run folders. date_source says which.
- Descriptions, stages and log pointers are hand-written in META below; everything numeric is computed here.
- Self-test first: known figures from the logs must reproduce (to 3 decimals), plus hand-read per-module counts.
  If any check fails, nothing is written and the exit code is 1.

External rows (one list each, not runs of ours): LAsset initial spec + RTL (load_refs()["paper"]), LAsset refined
(load_refs()["paper_refined"]), LAsset initial RTL-only (LAsset_initial_results/asset_list_neorv32_initial.json,
loaded uncapped the way assetgen_meta/hand_arms/read_ist2.py and assetgen_meta/lasset_layer.py load it).
