"""What the occurrence profiles and relation maps say about the 41 modules, beyond the asset list.

Source: only the published code-built maps (step1/lasset_step1/relation_map_code_{tuning,heldout}/b0e767000ec2_codetags/
<module>.json, read through traced_inputs.load_map so sub-unit connection directions are filled in), the SITE tags of
each occurrence stored next to them (<same folder>/_sites/<module>.json), and the flow graphs
(assetgen_meta/traced_inputs_v2/<split>/_flow/<module>.json). No model call. Deterministic: no randomness anywhere.

Terms used below (all read from map fields):
  element        one entry of the map's "ports" or "signals" list, keyed by (entity, name).
  record parent  an element whose name is the prefix of another element of the same entity (ctrl for ctrl.lock).
  leaf           an element that is not a record parent. Counts of registers, roles etc. are over leaves.
  input port     a port with boundary.mode "in" or "inout". Output port: mode "out", "inout" or "buffer".
  stored         effective storage "edge" or "mixed". A field takes the storage of its nearest enclosing record when
                 that record is "edge" or "mixed": `arbiter <= arbiter_nxt` under a clock edge stores every field of
                 arbiter (neorv32_bus line 763), even if the field itself is only assigned in the reset arm.
  register       a stored leaf signal (ports are counted apart, as stored outputs).
  condition site an occurrence of Y tagged IF_COND (in the condition of an if or elsif) or WHEN_COND (in the
                 condition of a conditional assignment, `x <= a when c else b`). Operand site: tagged RHS_OPERAND or
                 VAR_RHS_OPERAND (Y is joined to other names by an operator on the right-hand side). In these maps
                 every GATES record has all its "at" occurrences at condition sites or all at operand sites, never a
                 mix, and none at a case expression (a case selector writes SELECTS records); the self-test checks both.
  value edge     Y -> X when Y has a CARRIES or SOURCES record to X, or a GATES record to X at an operand site (Y is an
                 operand of the value X is given, as in neorv32_wdt line 95: `ctrl.lock <= bus_req_i.data(ctrl_lock_c) and ctrl.enable;`).
  condition gate Y -> X when Y has a GATES record to X at a condition site.
  control record a GATES record whose "at" occurrences are condition sites, any SELECTS record (in these maps at a
                 case expression or an index), or any CONSTRAINS record (in these maps at IF_COND or WHEN_COND). A GATES
                 record at an operand site is a value edge, not control: `cnt_started <= ctrl.enable and ...`
                 (neorv32_wdt line 130) gives ctrl.enable no control over cnt_started; `if (ctrl.enable = '0')`
                 (line 131) does give it control over cnt.
  write-data port an input port leaf whose name contains "data" and that is either
                 (a) a field whose own name contains "data", of a record port whose declared type name ends in "_req_t"
                     (a request record; the type is read from the port's declaration occurrence in the map, e.g.
                     `bus_req_i : in bus_req_t;`, neorv32_wdt line 24). In these maps: bus_req_t (field data, "write
                     data", neorv32_package line 123) and dmi_req_t (field data, line 173); or
                 (b) named as write data: the last part of its name contains "wdata" (wdata_i, csr_wdata_i,
                     ctrl_i.csr_wdata; ctrl_bus_t.csr_wdata is "write data" at neorv32_package line 568).
                 Response data (fields of bus_rsp_t, dmi_rsp_t), read data (xcsr_rdata_i) and stream data
                 (slink_rx_data_i) are not write-data ports.
  input-written register  a register with a value edge from an input port, one step. "From write data" when at
                 least one of those input ports is a write-data port, "from another input" when none is. The map does
                 not say whether the write is a configuration write: this also covers pin synchronisers, operand
                 latches and RAM arrays.

      entities              distinct entity names in the map
      ports, signals        entries of the map's "ports" and "signals" lists; elements = ports + signals
      record_parents        elements that are records with fields in the map
      occurrences           sum over elements of len(occurrences): every numbered name occurrence (Occurrence ID)
      records               relationship records as stored, both sides (a relation is written on both elements)
      records_data          records of type CARRIES, COPIES, SOURCES, DERIVES_FROM
      records_control       records of type GATES, GATED_BY, SELECTS, SELECTED_BY, CONSTRAINS, CONSTRAINED_BY, as
                            stored (GATES at operand sites included; this column is a record count, not control)
      records_timing        records of type SEQUENCES, CLOCKED_BY, RESETS, RESET_BY
      registers             stored leaf signals (storage "edge" or "mixed", own or inherited from the record)
      stored_outputs        leaf output ports that are stored (the port itself is a register)
      input_written_registers          registers with a value edge from an input port, one step
      input_written_from_write_data    of those, the ones with at least one write-data port among those inputs
      input_written_from_other_input   of those, the ones with no write-data port among those inputs (the two
                                       columns add up to input_written_registers)
      exported_registers    registers with a path of value edges to an output port through combinational signals only
                            (storage "none", not ports)
      registers_with_reset  registers with a RESET_BY record, on the register or on an enclosing record
      no_reset_share        1 - registers_with_reset / registers (None when there is no register). A map fact, not
                            exactly "no reset": the map writes no RESET_BY for a reset value built from a generic
                            (neorv32_cpu_control exe_engine.pc, line 271), so this is an upper bound.
      clocks                distinct names of elements that have a SEQUENCES record
      control_hubs          elements (ports included) with a GATES record at a condition site or a SELECTS record to at
                            least five distinct other elements (CONSTRAINS records are not counted here)
      top_hub               the hub with the most such targets, "name (n)"
      write_guards          elements with condition gates (GATES record at an IF_COND / WHEN_COND occurrence) to at
                            least two input-written registers other than themselves
      write_guards_internal write guards that are signals, not ports (state such as ctrl.lock, not the bus handshake)
      subunit_connections   entries of the elements' "connections" lists (one per port-map association)
      subunit_instances     distinct instance labels among those entries
      unused_elements       flow graph "no_local_use": no relationship, connection or constant driver. The flow graph
                            keys elements by name, so in the 7 files with several entities a name declared in two
                            entities is one node there (true for this and the next column only)
      control_only_sources  flow graph "control_only_inputs": sources that only gate or select, never carry a value
      reference_entries     entries of the manual reference for the module (not from the map; for comparison)

    Which elements each column counts:
      record parents included (every map element): entities, ports, signals, elements, occurrences, records,
        records_data, records_control, records_timing, subunit_connections, subunit_instances. record_parents counts
        only the parents.
      leaves only: registers, stored_outputs, input_written_registers, input_written_from_write_data,
        input_written_from_other_input, exported_registers, registers_with_reset, no_reset_share (all are counts of
        registers, which are leaves by definition), and the roles of roles() for leaves (a record parent there only
        copies a role from its fields).
      leaves in these maps: control_hubs, top_hub, write_guards, write_guards_internal and clocks are computed over
        every element, but no record parent has a GATES, SELECTS, CONSTRAINS or SEQUENCES record in the 41 maps
        (the self-test checks this), so every hub, guard and clock is a leaf. The registers a guard protects are leaves
